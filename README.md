A simple, interactive drawing application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This app allows users to draw different shapes (rectangle, circle, triangle), use a brush or eraser tool, and customize the brush size and color. Users can also save their drawings as images or clear the canvas.

## Features  

- **Drawing Tools**: Choose between brush, eraser, and shapes (rectangle, circle, triangle).  
- **Fill Color Option**: Option to fill the shapes with color or just outline them.  
- **Brush Customization**: Adjust brush size with a slider and select colors from a palette or color picker.  
- **Save Drawing**: Save your artwork as an image file.  
- **Clear Canvas**: Clear the entire canvas with one click.

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to start drawing.

## How It Works

2. **Tool Selection**: The user can select drawing tools, including brush, eraser, and different shapes (rectangle, circle, triangle).  
3. **Drawing Process**: As the user drags the mouse, the app draws on the canvas according to the selected tool.  
4. **Color and Size Customization**: Users can change the brush size and select colors either from predefined color buttons or the color picker.  
5. **Saving Images**: The app converts the canvas content into an image and allows the user to download it as a JPG file.  
6. **Clear Canvas**: Clears the canvas and resets the background to white.
